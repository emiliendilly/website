description: "Upon unwinding a helical rod, a critical point is reached at which a helix of opposite chirality appears at one end, connected to the original helix by a perversion — a well-known phenomenon observed in plants. With further rotation, the perversion migrates along the rod. Mechanical characterization of this migration shows that the axial torque exerted by the helix during the experiment remains nearly constant, exhibiting a behavior analogous to the Maxwell plateau in phase transitions. This perversion can thus function as a constant-torque actuator, with promising potential applications in soft robotics. "

##### Abstract

Mechanical stress and conformation of a helical elastic rod clamped at both ends was studied during the unwinding process. Reducing progressively the winding number from $N_0$ to $-N_0$ by rotation of one clamped end, we followed the conformation of the rod and monitored the torque $M_z$ and the tension $T$ exerted on the clamps, keeping the elongation between clamps constant.

The rod undergoes a complete chirality inversion from $N = N_0$ to $N = -N_0$. The intermediate states are superpositions of two states: one (chirality +) with positive winding number $N_+$ and one (chirality -) with negative winding number $N_-$, keeping $N = N_+ + N_-$. The junction between (+) and (-) is a **perversion**, which migrates along the rod upon changing $N$. 

The process of helix inversion is discussed within a simple model of phase coexistence. The effects of the perversion and of the clamps on the transition are discussed, and minimal theoretical models are proposed.
