description: "Tendrils are plant organs that generate curvature to create spring-like connections to supports, enabling climbing. This curvature often leads to the formation of helices, primarily arising from differential growth across the tendril’s cross section, acting as a bistrip-like curvature mechanism. The process is studied experimentally under varying boundary conditions, such as applied axial forces, and a model is proposed to explain and predict the different observed behaviors."

##### Abstract

We experimentally investigate cucumber tendril writhing, focusing on the dynamics of curvature generation under varying axial forces. At low forces, curvature saturates exponentially at a limiting value. Above a critical force, tendrils fail to coil, revealing two distinct coiling regimes. Growth measurements indicate that curvature arises from differential growth. To capture this behavior, we propose a bi-strip model in which one strip undergoes mechanosensitive growth. In the absence of external constraints, residual stresses within the bi-strip limit curvature generation. Under external force, the tendril is described as a Kirchhoff rod, and a nonlinear analysis of the curvature-generation equations reproduces the two observed regimes: below the critical axial force, the tendril coils; above it, the tendril remains straight, although intrinsic curvature is still present and becomes visible only once the force is removed.
